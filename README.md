Notice
------

**PLEASE NOTE this is not the official place to get WorldGuard, you can get the official version [here.](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard)** This version of WorldGuard is maintained for ClubObsidian and it's clients and others affiliated with it, use at your own risk.

Why hard fork
-------------

While we would love to soft-fork from the main [WorldGuard](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldGuard) repository soft-forking on Github still does not have proper code searching which is vital when tracking down bugs. If anyone from the WorldGuard team or anyone otherwise wants to submit changes please ask and we will gladly merge any changes upstream.


Patches
-------

* Built-in support for [foundry](https://github.com/clubobsidian/foundry) for permission caching

Information
-----------

WorldGuard lets you and players guard areas of land against griefers and undesirables, as well as tweak and disable various gameplay features of Minecraft.

* Block creeper and wither block damage, falling damage, etc.
* Disable fire spread, lava fire spread, ice formation, Endermen picking up blocks, etc.
* Blacklist certain items and blocks so they can't be used
* Warn moderators when certain items and blocks are used
* Protect areas of your world so only certain people can build in them
* Set areas where PVP, TNT, mob damage, and other features are disabled
* Protect your server from various 'exploits' like magical obsidian creation machines
* Disable, or enable, various Minecraft features, like sponges from classic
